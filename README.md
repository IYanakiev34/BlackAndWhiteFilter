# BlackAndWhiteFilter

This is a short **C** program which will take an input file of a **BMP** image(the user has to enter tha filename assuming the path to the image is in the  working folder). It is important that this image is not in any other format in order to work. The program create a black and white version of the image and puts in the workig folder as: **bw-pic.bmp**.

## What I learned
  - This was a very interesting project which could be expanded on. I go familiar with the BMP format of an image. 
  - How to extract and image and read the different parts of it.
  - Learning what kind of permutation to make on the pixels in order to create the black and white filter effect.

You can convert your image to a bmp one [here](https://convertimage.net/convert-a-picture/to-bmp/?s=jpg-to-bmp&i=20211007-003416-hmssg). Will be adding more filters and will try to support different format as well maybe TIFF.
